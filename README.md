# FLRTRX: User & Computer Interface + Local Oscillator Module

A radio with two modes: User and Computer. The User Interface allows direct human interaction through input mechanisms such as buttons and switches. Meanwhile, the Computer Interface leverages Data Terminal Ready (DTR) signals via a USB-Series board to control the TX/RX switch. A high DTR signal activates TX mode, while a low signal engages RX mode.

To enable computer control over the Local Oscillator Frequency (fLO) and TX/RX switch, we’ve integrated a microcontroller (MCU). This setup uses a Computer-Aided Transceiver (CAT) to communicate through a serial protocol. Commands are translated by a daughter card, specifically the FT232 module, into Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) signals, TXD, and RXD.

Importantly, control over the TX/RX switch is exclusive to the User or Computer interface at any given time, ensuring seamless and efficient operation.
